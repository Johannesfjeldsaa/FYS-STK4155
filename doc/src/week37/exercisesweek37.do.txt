=====  Overarching aims of the exercises this week =====


This exercise deals with various mean values and variances in  linear regression method (here it may be useful to look up chapter 3, equation (3.8) of "Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome H. Friedman, The Elements of Statistical Learning, Springer":"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570"). The exercise is also a part of project 1 and can be reused in the theory part of the project.




The assumption we have made is 
that there exists a continuous function $f(\bm{x})$ and  a normal distributed error $\bm{\varepsilon}\sim N(0, \sigma^2)$
which describes our data
!bt
\[
\bm{y} = f(\bm{x})+\bm{\varepsilon}
\]
!et

We then approximate this function $f(\bm{x})$ with our model $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ from the solution of the linear regression equations (ordinary least squares OLS), that is our
function $f$ is approximated by $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ where we minimized  $(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2$, with
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et
The matrix $\bm{X}$ is the so-called design or feature matrix. 


Show that  the expectation value of $\bm{y}$ for a given element $i$ 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}(y_i)  =\sum_{j}x_{ij} \beta_j=\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}, 
\]
!et
and that
its variance is 
!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}(y_i)  = \sigma^2.  
\]
!et
Hence, $y_i \sim N( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}, \sigma^2)$, that is $\bm{y}$ follows a normal distribution with 
mean value $\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

With the OLS expressions for the optimal parameters $\bm{\hat{\beta}}$ show that
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}(\bm{\hat{\beta}}) = \bm{\beta}.
\]
!et
Show finally that the variance of $\bm{\beta}$ is
!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}(\bm{\hat{\beta}}) = \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}.
\]
!et


We can use the last expression when we define a so-called confidence interval for the parameters $\beta$. 
A given parameter $\beta_j$ is given by the diagonal matrix element of the above matrix.
